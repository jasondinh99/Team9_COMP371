##How to run program
Use Visual Studio 2022, and open Models.sln

## Objective
The goal of our project is to create a procedurally modeled world of a forest using OpenGL. The user of the program would be able to move around the procedurally created virtual forest, which contains different kinds of trees. During navigation, the user is not allowed to pass through objects.

## Control keys
- ESCAPE: close window
- WASD: move around (hold LEFT SHIFT to move faster)
- 1: switch to 1st person view
- 2: switch to static camera #1
- 3: switch to static camera #2
- X/Z: zoom in/out
- HOME: enable gravity for FP camera
- END: disable gravity for FP camera
- P/L/F: render everything in points, lines, fill (respectively)
